# Next.js Routing Fixes Applied

## Issue Summary
The application was experiencing the following errors:
1. **404 Error on /generate route** - The route was not accessible
2. **Missing required error components** - Missing not-found.tsx component
3. **Continuous refresh loop** - The page kept refreshing with error messages

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created Missing `not-found.tsx` Component
**File**: `/app/not-found.tsx`
- Created a proper 404 page component with Next.js App Router structure
- Includes navigation links to help users get back to valid pages
- Styled consistently with the application's theme (black background, yellow accents)

### 2. Verified Existing Components
The following components were already properly configured:
- `/app/error.tsx` - Error boundary component
- `/app/global-error.tsx` - Global error handler
- `/app/generate/page.tsx` - Generate page with proper default export
- `/app/generate/layout.tsx` - Layout wrapper for generate page

### 3. Test Results
All routes are now working correctly:

#### Page Routes (All return 200 OK):
- `/` - Home page
- `/generate` - Image generation page
- `/login` - Login page
- `/gallery` - Gallery page
- `/profile` - Profile page
- `/subscription` - Subscription page
- `/dashboard` - Dashboard page

#### Error Handling (Working correctly):
- Non-existent routes now show the custom 404 page
- API errors are properly caught and displayed

## Testing Verification

### Manual Testing
Created `test-routes.html` for comprehensive route testing:
```bash
# Open in browser
open /Users/crusialee/Desktop/SparkInc/009-nanobanana-ios/nextjs-backend/test-routes.html
```

### Command Line Testing
```bash
# Test generate route
curl -I http://localhost:3000/generate
# Returns: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ✓

# Test 404 handling
curl -I http://localhost:3000/non-existent
# Returns: HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found ✓
```

## Development Server Status
The Next.js development server is running without routing errors:
- Server URL: http://localhost:3000
- All routes compile successfully
- No missing component errors

## Additional Notes

### API Issue (Separate from routing)
There's an unrelated Gemini API error due to regional availability, but this doesn't affect the routing functionality:
- Error: "Model gemini-pro is not available. Please check model availability in your region"
- This should be addressed separately by configuring the correct Gemini model for your region

### Key Files Structure
```
/app
├── not-found.tsx        ✓ Created (handles 404s)
├── error.tsx           ✓ Exists (handles errors)
├── global-error.tsx    ✓ Exists (global error boundary)
├── layout.tsx          ✓ Exists (root layout)
├── page.tsx           ✓ Exists (home page)
└── generate/
    ├── page.tsx       ✓ Exists (generate page)
    └── layout.tsx     ✓ Exists (generate layout)
```

## Conclusion
All routing issues have been resolved. The application now has:
1. ✅ Working /generate route
2. ✅ Proper error handling components
3. ✅ Custom 404 page for non-existent routes
4. ✅ No refresh loops
5. ✅ All required Next.js App Router components in place

The application's routing system is now fully functional and follows Next.js 15 best practices.
