# Subscription Page Infinite Loading Loop - Fixed

## Issue Description
The subscription page at https://www.nanobanana.plus/subscription was stuck in an infinite loading loop due to React hook dependencies causing continuous re-renders.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Unstable Object Reference (Primary Issue)
**Problem:** The `defaultPlans` array was being recreated on every render using `Object.values(SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS)`, causing the `fetchSubscriptionStatus` callback to be recreated due to changed dependencies, which triggered the `useEffect` on every render.

```typescript
// Before (caused infinite loop):
const defaultPlans: SubscriptionPlan[] = Object.values(SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS);
```

### 2. API Response Mismatch
**Problem:** The API client expected different field names than what the API was returning, causing potential issues with data handling.

### 3. Missing Auth Loading State
**Problem:** The component didn't properly handle the authentication loading state, potentially showing incorrect UI states.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Memoized defaultPlans Array
**File:** `/app/subscription/page.tsx`
```typescript
// After (stable reference):
const defaultPlans = React.useMemo<SubscriptionPlan[]>(() => Object.values(SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS), []);
```
This ensures the array reference remains stable across renders, preventing unnecessary re-execution of dependent hooks.

### 2. Fixed API Response Mapping
**File:** `/lib/api/client.ts`
```typescript
async getSubscriptionStatus(): Promise<{
  subscription: Subscription | null;
  available_plans: any[];
}> {
  const response = await this.client.get('/api/subscription/status');
  // Map the API response to the expected format
  return {
    subscription: response.data.active_subscription || null,
    available_plans: response.data.available_plans || []
  };
}
```
This properly maps the API response fields to match what the component expects.

### 3. Added Proper Auth Loading State Handling
**File:** `/app/subscription/page.tsx`
```typescript
const { user, isAuthenticated, isLoading: authLoading } = useAuth();

// Updated useEffect to handle auth loading
useEffect(() => {
  if (!authLoading) {
    if (isAuthenticated) {
      fetchSubscriptionStatus();
    } else {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, authLoading, fetchSubscriptionStatus]);

// Show loading while auth is being checked
if (authLoading || isLoading) {
  return <Loading />;
}
```

## Testing Performed

Created and ran test script (`/scripts/test-subscription-page.js`) that verified:
- ✅ Unauthenticated requests properly return 401
- ✅ Invalid tokens are properly rejected
- ✅ Valid authentication successfully fetches subscription status
- ✅ Response structure is correctly mapped
- ✅ No infinite loops occur

## Impact

These fixes resolve the infinite loading loop by:
1. Eliminating unstable object references in React dependencies
2. Ensuring proper data flow between API and UI components
3. Correctly handling all loading states
4. Preventing circular dependency updates

The subscription page now loads correctly and displays the appropriate content based on authentication status.
