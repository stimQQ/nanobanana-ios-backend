# Image Persistence Issue - FIXED

## Problem Description
Users reported that generated images were disappearing after page refresh. This was a critical data persistence issue affecting the core functionality of the application.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Database Column Mismatch**
   - The API was trying to save `image_url` but the database column was named `output_image_url`
   - This caused a silent failure where images were generated but not saved to the database

2. **Missing Status Field**
   - Generated images were not having their status set to 'completed'
   - This could cause them to not appear properly in the gallery

3. **Invalid Column Reference**
   - The API was trying to insert a `language` field that doesn't exist in the table schema
   - This caused the entire insert operation to fail

4. **Insufficient Error Logging**
   - Database save failures were being silently ignored
   - Made it difficult to diagnose the issue

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Database Column Names
**File:** `/app/api/generate/image/route.ts`

Changed:
```javascript
// Before
image_url: imageUrl,

// After
output_image_url: imageUrl,
```

### 2. Added Status Field
```javascript
status: 'completed',  // Now properly set when image is generated
```

### 3. Fixed Language Field Storage
```javascript
// Before (incorrect - field doesn't exist)
language,

// After (stored in metadata)
metadata: { language }
```

### 4. Added Input Images Tracking
```javascript
input_images: input_images,  // Now properly saved for image-to-image generations
```

### 5. Enhanced Error Logging
Added comprehensive logging to track:
- Storage upload attempts and results
- Database save operations
- Public URL generation
- Error details with proper context

## Verification

Created test script at `/scripts/test-image-persistence.js` that:
1. Authenticates a test user
2. Generates an image
3. Verifies it's saved in the database
4. Fetches the gallery to confirm persistence

Test results: **✅ SUCCESS**
- Images are now properly persisting
- Images are saved to Supabase storage
- Image URLs are correctly saved to database
- Images appear in gallery after refresh

## Technical Details

### Database Schema (image_generations table)
```sql
- id: UUID
- user_id: UUID (foreign key to users)
- prompt: TEXT
- input_images: TEXT[] (array)
- output_image_url: TEXT  -- This was the problematic field
- generation_type: VARCHAR(50)
- credits_used: INTEGER
- status: VARCHAR(50)  -- Must be set to 'completed'
- error_message: TEXT
- metadata: JSONB  -- Used for additional data like language
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
```

### API Response Flow
1. Generate image via Gemini API
2. Upload to Supabase storage bucket 'images'
3. Get public URL for the uploaded image
4. Save generation record to database with correct field names
5. Return success response with image URL

## Impact

- ✅ Users can now view all their generated images in the gallery
- ✅ Images persist across page refreshes
- ✅ Historical generations are properly tracked
- ✅ Storage is properly utilized for better performance

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding a background job to verify storage uploads
2. Implement retry logic for failed storage uploads
3. Add monitoring/alerting for database save failures
4. Consider adding a migration to rename database columns for consistency

## Files Modified

1. `/app/api/generate/image/route.ts` - Fixed column names, added status, improved logging
2. `/scripts/test-image-persistence.js` - Created comprehensive test script

## How to Test

Run the test script:
```bash
node scripts/test-image-persistence.js
```

Or manually:
1. Generate an image through the UI
2. Refresh the page
3. Go to Gallery
4. Verify the image appears and loads correctly

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - All image persistence issues have been resolved. Images now properly save to both Supabase storage and the database, and persist across page refreshes.
