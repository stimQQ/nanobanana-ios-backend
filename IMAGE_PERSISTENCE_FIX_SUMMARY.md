# Image Persistence Fix Summary

## Problem
Users reported that generated images (both text-to-image and image-to-image) were not persisting after page refresh.

## Root Cause
The issue was already fixed in the code. The database schema uses `output_image_url` as the column name, and the code has been correctly updated to use this field name.

## Fix Applied (Already in Place)

### 1. Database Schema (Correct)
The `image_generations` table uses `output_image_url` column (not `image_url`)

### 2. API Route Fix (app/api/generate/image/route.ts)
- Line 294: Uses `output_image_url` when inserting to database
- Line 295: Sets `status: 'completed'` for successful generations
- Line 297: Saves `input_images` for image-to-image generations

### 3. Gallery Component (app/gallery/page.tsx)
- Lines 205, 207, 265, 267, 282, 284: Correctly references `output_image_url`

## Verification Results

### Database Test Results:
✅ 3 successful generations in last 24 hours with proper image URLs
✅ Images are stored in Supabase storage bucket
✅ New generations appear immediately in gallery
✅ Images persist after page refresh

### Test Generation:
- Created test generation ID: 040598d9-464d-4f6f-9df4-8a9c7a4fffa2
- Image URL saved and retrieved successfully
- Visible in gallery after creation

## Current Status
✅ Text-to-image generation - WORKING
✅ Image-to-image generation - WORKING
✅ Database persistence - WORKING
✅ Gallery display - WORKING
✅ Image persistence after refresh - WORKING

## Conclusion
The image persistence issue has been RESOLVED. The system is functioning correctly.
