# Stripe API Key Initialization Fix - Summary

## Problem
The build was failing with the error: "Error: Neither apiKey nor config.authenticator provided" because Stripe was being initialized at the module level with environment variables that might not be available during build time.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Lazy Initialization of Stripe Client
**File:** `/lib/config/stripe.ts`

- Replaced direct Stripe initialization with a lazy initialization pattern
- Created `getStripe()` function that initializes Stripe only when needed
- Added proper error handling for missing environment variables
- Implemented a Proxy for backward compatibility with existing code

Key changes:
- Stripe client is now initialized on first use, not at module load time
- Build phase no longer fails when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is not available
- Runtime errors are thrown only when Stripe functionality is actually accessed

### 2. Fixed ESLint Warnings for Unused Parameters
Fixed unused parameters by prefixing with underscore in the following API routes:

**Routes with unused request parameters:**
- `/app/api/status/route.ts`
- `/app/api/health/route.ts`
- `/app/api/user/profile/route.ts`
- `/app/api/user/generations/route.ts`
- `/app/api/user/credits/route.ts`
- `/app/api/subscription/status/route.ts`
- `/app/api/chat/sessions/route.ts` (OPTIONS only)
- `/app/api/chat/messages/route.ts` (OPTIONS only)
- `/app/api/subscription/purchase/route.ts` (OPTIONS only)

Changed: `request: NextRequest` → `_request: NextRequest`

Note: Routes using `withAuth(request, ...)` were preserved as they actually use the request parameter.

## Result
✅ Build now succeeds on Vercel
✅ Stripe initialization is deferred until runtime
✅ ESLint warnings reduced significantly
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Deployment Notes
When deploying to Vercel, ensure the following environment variables are set in the Vercel dashboard:
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Your Stripe secret API key
- `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_BASIC` - Price ID for basic tier
- `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO` - Price ID for pro tier
- `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PREMIUM` - Price ID for premium tier
- `STRIPE_PRODUCT_ID_BASIC` - Product ID for basic tier
- `STRIPE_PRODUCT_ID_PRO` - Product ID for pro tier
- `STRIPE_PRODUCT_ID_PREMIUM` - Product ID for premium tier

The application will build successfully even without these variables, but Stripe functionality will fail at runtime if they're not provided.
